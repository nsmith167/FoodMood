BEN:
UI Pattern: Navigation
  Provided navigation throughout the application through the use of buttons and actionlisteners.
OO Pattern: Factory
  Created FoodMoodFactory that works with an Entry interface to provide access to two different types of entries; Food and Mood.
  This will prove useful later in the development of the application. A test class demonstrating its capabilities has been provided.
