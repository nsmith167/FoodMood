BEN:
UI Pattern: Navigation
  Provided navigation throughout the application through the use of buttons and actionlisteners.
OO Pattern: Factory
  Created FoodMoodFactory that works with an Entry interface to provide access to two different types of entries; Food and Mood.
  This will prove useful later in the development of the application. A test class demonstrating its capabilities has been provided.

ZACH:
UI Pattern: Settings
 - Created a user settings window class (SettingsView) showing a basic layout of different user settings. Only 2 are shown, but this can be expanded later.

OO Pattern: Iteration
 - Added a loop with if-statements in SettingsView to gather settings value from an array. Isn't that relevant now, but can be adjusted to fit later goals and other uses
